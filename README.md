# Awesome Blogdown
An awesome curated list of blogs built using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).

## About Blogdown

The blogdown package for R lets you create static websites using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Sites are rendered to static files which simplifies publishing and hosting, at the same time as allowing you to easily version control your site.
